# Pykachu Volleyball Notes

- Reference: https://velog.io/@frog_slayer/gym-Pykachu-volleyball
- Target environment design: Gymnasium compatible with `render_mode` options "rgb_array" or "human".
- Action space: Discrete mapping for jump/move/spike actions (exact mapping TBD).
- `env/pykachu_env.py` only contains commented method signatures (reset/step/render/close); implementation is TODO.
- Training/evaluation/random-play scripts are placeholders that only print TODO messages until logic is added.
